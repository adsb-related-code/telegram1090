/**
 * Telegram Bot Service
 *
 * This service will handle all communication with the telegram clients.
 * Planned responsibilities, ordered by priority:
 *   1. Accept start commands from new users
 *   2. Require basic password authentication from new users
 *   3. Provide an API for the initializer to globally message all saved users
 *
 * Future ideas:
 *   - Persist users to disk for recovery after process shutdown
 *   - Provide an API for the initializer to respond to commands
 *   - More advanced auth challenge?
